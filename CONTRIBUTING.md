## How to Submit Code

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
3. **Make your changes**, writing or updating tests as needed.
4. **Verify locally** (see [Local Development Setup](#local-development-setup) below).
5. **Open a Pull Request** targeting `main` and fill out the PR template.

> **Note:** @pthoor reviews all PRs. Please be patient — every PR will receive a thorough review.

## Local Development Setup

### Run Pester tests
```powershell
Invoke-Pester
```

### Lint PowerShell code
```powershell
# Lint src directory
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ./src -Recurse -Severity Warning,Error

# Lint scripts directory
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path ./scripts -Recurse -Severity Warning,Error
```

### Validate Bicep
```bash
az bicep build --file infra/main.bicep
```

### Detection rule validation
`tests/DetectionRules.Tests.ps1` (part of `Invoke-Pester` above) statically validates
`detections/*.yaml` against the Sentinel analytics rule schema - no Azure access
needed, runs on every PR. A separate, maintainer-only CI workflow additionally
validates detection rules against a real Sentinel workspace; see
[docs/CI_LIVE_VALIDATION.md](docs/CI_LIVE_VALIDATION.md) if you're setting that up.

### Deploying code changes
If you're testing infra/code changes against a real deployment, see
[docs/DEPLOYING_CODE_UPDATES.md](docs/DEPLOYING_CODE_UPDATES.md) for the
`scmAccessMode` options and which one fits manual deploys vs. CI/CD.

## Code Standards

- **PSScriptAnalyzer** — All PowerShell code must pass with no warnings or errors at `Warning` severity and above.
- **Bicep** — All Bicep files must compile without errors (`az bicep build`).
- **Error handling** — Use `try/catch` blocks for all external calls and resource access.
- **No secrets** — Never commit credentials, passwords, API keys, or connection strings. Use Azure Key Vault references.
- **Versioning (SemVer)** — Any user-impacting change must bump version metadata in the same PR. This includes changes to function behavior, parser/schema outputs, detections, workbook queries/UX, and deployment contracts. Internal-only changes (comments, formatting, refactors with no behavior change, and test-only edits) do not require a version bump.
